Hi! I'm Jo√£o, a Software Engineer, Tech Lead and Engineering Manager at <a href="https://free-now.com" target="_blank">FREE NOW</a>*.

I'm mainly interested in reactive distributed systems, cloud technologies, and software craftsmanship. I believe that in order to transform a business to be 10x bigger, we need to enable and empower companies' biggest asset: people.
