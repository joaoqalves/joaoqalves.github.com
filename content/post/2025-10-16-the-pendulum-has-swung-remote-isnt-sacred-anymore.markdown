A few years ago, I [wrote](http://bit.ly/42HeM4Y) that remote work was here to stay. I still believe that. The nuance I missed: remote is a tool, not a belief system. Some teams will win by being remote-first. Others will win by being together. Both can work.

[Factorial](https://factorialhr.co/), a Barcelona-based startup that builds HR software, just made a clear choice: **five days in the office, one flex day if your manager agrees**.

If you follow [ITNIG's podcast](https://itnig.net/podcast) (Spanish), you already know where [Bernat Farrero](https://x.com/bernatfarrero) and [Jordi Romero](https://x.com/jordiromero) stood. They've always valued in-person energy. Now they're doubling down. They also recently announced a big office in Barcelona where "everyone can fit, and where we don't need Zoom".

I respect it, but I know it wouldn't work for me. With two kids and a commute from outside Barcelona, it would kill my work-life balance. It may seem contradictory, but both things can be true.

# Why leaders are changing direction

The vibe shifted. Many leadership teams feel that full remote comes at a cost: the human part. Over the last few years, I've seen the same patterns repeat:

1. **Junior team members frequently struggle** to find their footing in a remote work environment. Relying solely on platforms like Slack for communication does not facilitate effective learning and knowledge transfer. Engaging in discussions, asking questions, and seeking guidance in real-time are essential for their development. Without these opportunities for interaction, it becomes challenging for them to absorb critical information and navigate their roles successfully.
2. **Consistency often slips away** from teams when there's a lack of informal connections. Without hallway chats, those spur-of-the-moment brainstorming sessions, or casual lunch discussions, creativity can take a hit.
3. **The company vibe starts to fade away.** People become less engaged and lose track of what everyone else is working on. It’s like we’re all in our own bubbles, and that connection starts to slip.

Remote work can work. It just needs more maturity, structure, and written culture than most companies can sustain.

# Hybrid is getting a shape

Hybrid used to mean “come in whenever you want.” That didn’t work. Now we’re seeing companies set more explicit rules: fixed days in the office, or recurring rituals that bring people together. Some teams anchor around midweek days for planning and collaboration. Others design specific in-office moments: demos, retros, onboarding, and monthly all-hands.

The goal is **consistency**. People need to know when showing up matters. It’s not perfect, but it’s better than pretending flexibility alone will solve coordination. A hybrid without structure is just remote with traffic.

# Remote is still an edge for small teams

Here's the part people forget: **remote is again a competitive advantage** for small or underfunded teams. If you can't pay FAANG-level salaries, rent a fancy office, or offer daycare, remote lets you compete.

Hire globally. Build a written-first, async-first culture. Operate with focus and clarity.

Most companies fail with remote work because they copy office culture into video conferences. The ones that design for async from day one still have an edge.

# On Factorial

Factorial built a unicorn from Barcelona. They've earned the right to pick their model. Some people will leave. That's fine. A culture that tries to please everyone ends up pleasing no one.

If they want tighter collaboration, faster feedback, and stronger apprenticeship, five days in the office is a coherent call. I hope they back it with design, intention, and family support. If they do, it’ll work.

# Final thoughts

Remote was the cool kid. Co-location is the comeback kid. The market changed, people changed, priorities changed. That’s fine.

The smart move isn’t picking a side. It’s knowing what problem you’re solving. For some, that’s rebuilding culture through proximity. For others, it’s maintaining focus through async work.

There’s no one-size-fits-all. Only tradeoffs. Pick yours and commit.
