      <description>Bob: &amp;ldquo;Hey, what will we use to communicate with X in this project?&amp;rdquo;
Ted: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re using library Y, of course! 5k stars at Github. Looks solid!&amp;rdquo;
(5 months later&amp;hellip;)
Bob: &amp;ldquo;Ted, we have a problem. We need to update X and library Y does not have support for it.&amp;rdquo;
Ted: &amp;ldquo;Hmmm&amp;hellip; We could just monkey-patch Y and then create our own in-house version. Problem solved!&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Hi! This is my first post in this blog. Although it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be a tech blog, this post is the first part of a series where I mix software engineering, its practices and methodologies with a business background and why do software companies need to move towards continuous deployment. Stay tunned!
Background and Motivation The world has changed a lot in the last 100 years. But if we stop to think about it, did it change more from 1900 until 1970 or from 1970 until now?</description>
