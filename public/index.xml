      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m João, a Software Engineer, Tech Lead and Engineering Manager at FREE NOW*.
I&amp;rsquo;m mainly interested in reactive distributed systems, cloud technologies, and software craftsmanship. I believe that in order to transform a business to be 10x bigger, we need to enable and empower companies&amp;rsquo; biggest asset: people.
* Opinions are my own. But I think that they should be yours too :)</description>

      <description>Code reviews are - or they should be - an important part of any software creation process. They allow people get to know better the different code bases within their companies. Also, they learn from others and try to understand the reasoning, trade-offs and solutions about a somewhat complex problem. Moreover, people strive to improve each others&amp;rsquo; code: &amp;ldquo;Hey, we should add some tests here&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we use a functional interface here?</description>

      <title>The casino paradox</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2:37am and you already lost 3000$ in the casino. &amp;ldquo;Just put 1000$ more in this blackjack round&amp;rdquo; - said no one, ever. This is the same feeling I have many times in software engineering projects. I mean, yeah, I get it, 2 years ago you needed to spent the minimum amount of time possible to get the work done. That&amp;rsquo;s fine. You delivered, you got customers, everything went well.</description>

      <description>Bob: &amp;ldquo;Hey, what will we use to communicate with X in this project?&amp;rdquo;
Ted: &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re using library Y, of course! 5k stars at Github. Looks solid!&amp;rdquo;
(5 months later&amp;hellip;)
Bob: &amp;ldquo;Ted, we have a problem. We need to update X and library Y does not have support for it.&amp;rdquo;
Ted: &amp;ldquo;Hmmm&amp;hellip; We could just monkey-patch Y and then create our own in-house version. Problem solved!&amp;rdquo;
(and then it begins&amp;hellip;)</description>

      <title>Towards Continuous Deployment</title>
      <link>https://blog.joaoqalves.net/post/2015/10/14/Towards-Continuous-Deployment/</link>

      <description>Hi! This is my first post in this blog. Although it&amp;rsquo;s meant to be a tech blog, this post is the first part of a series where I mix software engineering, its practices and methodologies with a business background and why do software companies need to move towards continuous deployment. Stay tunned!
Background and Motivation The world has changed a lot in the last 100 years. But if we stop to think about it, did it change more from 1900 until 1970 or from 1970 until now?</description>
